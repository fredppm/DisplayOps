#### 4.1 System Monitoring
- [ ] Implement host agent health reporting
- [ ] Add browser process monitoring
- [ ] Create dashboard responsiveness checks
- [ ] Add screenshot capture for verification

#### 4.2 Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Implement automatic error recovery
- [ ] Add logging and alerting system
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Test failure scenarios

**Deliverable**: Robust system with self-healing capabilities

### Phase 5: Auto-Update System (Week 7)
**Goal**: Implement automatic updates for Electron host agents

#### 5.1 Update Mechanism
- [ ] Integrate Electron's autoUpdater module
- [ ] Create update server in web controller for Electron releases
- [ ] Implement secure update checking and downloading
- [ ] Test update rollback mechanisms with Electron

#### 5.2 Version Management
- [ ] Implement version tracking
- [ ] Add update scheduling
- [ ] Create update notifications
- [ ] Test with multiple agent versions

**Deliverable**: Self-updating system requiring minimal maintenance

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Week 8+)
**Goal**: Add advanced management and monitoring features

#### 6.1 Advanced Web Interface
- [ ] Create comprehensive dashboard
- [ ] Add real-time status monitoring
- [ ] Implement configuration import/export
- [ ] Add user management features

#### 6.2 Scheduling & Automation
- [ ] Implement dashboard scheduling
- [ ] Add automatic rotation features
- [ ] Create time-based configurations
- [ ] Add holiday/weekend handling

**Deliverable**: Production-ready system with advanced management capabilities

## Development Order & Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. **Communication** → **Browser Control** → **Cookie Sync** → **Monitoring**
2. Each phase builds upon the previous
3. Testing should be continuous throughout

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Web interface can be developed alongside backend features
- Documentation can be written while implementing features
- Testing can be automated as features are completed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **mDNS discovery**: Test on different network configurations and firewalls
- **Network segmentation**: Ensure mDNS works across office network topology
- **Electron performance**: Test with multiple windows and displays early
- **Cookie compatibility**: Test with all required dashboards using Electron sessions
- **Network reliability**: Implement robust retry mechanisms for both discovery and commands
- **Multi-display support**: Test various monitor configurations thoroughly

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to defined phases
- **Integration issues**: Test integration points early
- **Performance issues**: Profile and optimize continuously

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- Web controller can communicate with all 4 mini PCs
- Commands are received and acknowledged
- Basic error handling works

### Phase 2 Success
- All 8 TVs can display different dashboards via Electron windows
- Electron windows operate in proper kiosk mode on correct displays
- Automatic recovery from window crashes using IPC

### Phase 3 Success
- No manual login required for any dashboard
- Authentication persists for expected duration
- Cookie sync works reliably

### Final Success
- System operates for weeks without manual intervention
- All TVs consistently display correct content
- Easy to add new dashboards or reconfigure TVs

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Load testing with all 8 TVs active

### Performance Targets
- System startup < 2 minutes
- Dashboard loading < 30 seconds
- Command response < 5 seconds
- Memory usage < 1GB per mini PC

### Reliability Targets
- 99% uptime for host agents
- 95% dashboard availability
- Recovery from failures < 2 minutes
- Zero data loss during updates
